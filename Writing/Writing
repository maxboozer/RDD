The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether stricter punishments and laws regarding drunk driving will reduce the amount of people that operate a motor
vehicle while under the influence. The data was taken from administrative records on over 500,000 BAC tests in Washington between the years 1995 and 2011. 
A regression discontinuity model is used for this experiment and several different characteristics of the drivers are controlled for such as age,
gender, prior offenses, etc. Punishments like BAC thresholds, sanctions, and rehabilitation where considered to see if there was a correlation between decreased 
rates of drunk driving with increased amounts of consequences. Overall, it was found that an increase of sanctions for drunk drivers did result in a decrease
in operating a car under the influence. A limit of this study is that you cannot control for people that may have been first-time drunk drivers but
the higher sanctions made them decide not to.
